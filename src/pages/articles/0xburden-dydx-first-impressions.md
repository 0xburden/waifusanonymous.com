# dYdX First Impressions Thread

the following is a direct copy of a Twitter thread first started on August 3, 2021 and was added to over the course of days/weeks after  

```
  
```

__[@0xburden](https://twitter.com/0xburden)__:  
Alright going to try using dYdX as a direct replacement for FTX in my trading for a while. Will probably thread this tweet with findings.  

9:06AM Aug 3, 2021

```

__[@0xburden](https://twitter.com/0xburden)__:  
Preface:  
I largely trade majors such as BTC, ETH, SOL, LINK, SNX and COMP at between 3x-10x  

I tried other products e.g. Perp, Fulcrum and Mango Markets  

dYdX offered the experience I was looking for, the others products are still all very cool

__[@0xburden](https://twitter.com/0xburden)__:  
I value being able to switch between devices easily, and do a lot of trading on a tablet device in addition to laptop. The dYdX web UI adapts well and switching between the two devices  leaves nothing to be desired - I can’t same the same thing going from the FTX app <> website

```
  
```

__[@0xburden](https://twitter.com/0xburden)__:  
Onboarding funds was not any more painful than setting up a CEX account in my experience. I was into a position almost immediately after deposit into L2 (I was setting this up during price action I thought was favorable) 

Soon after I actually moved funds off of Perp to use here

```

__[@0xburden](https://twitter.com/0xburden)__:  
UI display of open positions and orders is actually nicer than on FTX in my opinion. uPNL is shown in real time and all interactions are rather snappy. Very impressive even by CEX standards. 

Other products felt like using Kraken in 2019 for me.  

9:40AM Aug 3, 2021

```

__[@0xburden](https://twitter.com/0xburden)__:  
On collateral and leverage:

Cross collateral margin tracked and displayed very well -- leverage offered up to 25x I think at the time of this tweet (FTX max is 20x)

I don't know how liquidations work and plan on never finding out.

__[@0xburden](https://twitter.com/0xburden)__:  
Just tried closing out multiple positions by limit order.

Takes a little while but I'm getting fills.

Trailing stop also works as expected -- same as a CEX like Phemex, etc. (not that I use or recommend trailing stops often)

TODO:
* try stop limit orders

__[@0xburden](https://twitter.com/0xburden)__:  
Post-only is an option, really wish reduce-only was as well -- just accidentally opened a short due to stale sell bid left over after I closed a position.

Some parts of the dashboard don't update in real-time like one might expect given how snappy the rest of the UI is.

```
  
```

__[@0xburden](https://twitter.com/0xburden)__:  
After a day or so, still using dYdX just fine.

Some thoughts: 
* uPNL and realized PNL are displayed separately, thus you can see yourself paying out funding in real time. I really like this and missed it switching from Phemex to FTX/Binance Futs

__[@0xburden](https://twitter.com/0xburden)__:  
* Stop limit and trailing stop are the only options given, no stop market. Perhaps a limitation of their orderbook implementation ? Either way stop limit worked fine to get me out of a position yesterday  

* Getting limit fills seems to be harder w/ size, so I set many small orders

7:57AM Aug 4, 2021

```
  
```

__[@0xburden](https://twitter.com/0xburden)__:  
* Stop limit orders have gotten me out of positions with no issues at this point, must just work as opposed to potentially missing a fill on CEX?

* Other than annoying to get filled on limits given current liquidity, no other complaints.

* wen DPI or comparable DEFI index ??

First time taking some funds out of the L2, fast withdrawal -- pretty easy, fees were okay.

So far so good using dYdX exclusively for deriv trading for a little while. Will happily continue. Need more liquid markets for sure but that's about it.

__[@0xburden](https://twitter.com/0xburden)__:  
Experienced a full liquidation. Briefly there wasn’t actually enough liquidity to close my position. 

Ouch, but we keep on trading. 

p.s. tried using mango markets during this same period of volatility and it was nearly unusable during some moments.
