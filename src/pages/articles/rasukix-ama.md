# Rasukix AMA

__[@CryptoIppo](https://twitter.com/CryptoIppo): How to become a CS:GO god like you?__

Put simply, 3000 hours.

__[@Petts5](https://twitter.com/Petts5): Why no Sam?__

We only stan Jabami Yumeko in the house of Rasuki.

__[@KianaXBT](https://twitter.com/KianaXBT): Any specific mantra you live by & related goals for the future?__

Hmmm, I guess it would be 'work smart, not hard' as well as 'treat others the way you want to be treated'. In regards to future goals, my main goal is to solidify MangaDAO and be able to have it setup as a publishing house for NFT Manga.

__[@iSnake4life](https://twitter.com/iSnake4life): What is the most useful thing you own?__

Without a doubt my PC, I've been living in the metaverse since acquiring one.

__[@0xrubiks](https://twitter.com/0xrubiks): Wen OHM ATH?__

Sooooooooooooooooooooooon. Just park your funds, go watch all of Naruto, and let that compounding get to work baby!

__[@0xburden](https://twitter.com/0xburden): How are things with MangaDAO going?__

Pretty smooth. I wasn't expecting such an enthusiatic reponse from DAO members, especially considering it's all voluntary.  With this being my first DAO experience, I truly want it to flourish and be able to provide an income to members in the future for their contributions.

__[@0xJim](https://twitter.com/0xJim): Wtf is @waifusanonymous?__


A comfy collection of crypto consumers.

__[@todomarukaori](https://twitter.com/todomarukaori): Origin of your name Rasuki?__

Now this is a top meme! It originates from the days I would use pictochat on my Nintendo DS. We all had different aliases within our group and the name I chose was Rasuki12 (I was 12 at the time).

__[@tangfeng0x](https://twitter.com/tangfeng0x): Should we do CultureDao and have subdao for manga, anime, hentai, LN, art?__

I think for now with our level of human resources, we should stick to small, precise targets. If we accomplish those successfully, we can then expand onto other ventures.  It's important to remember we are still incredibly early in the space and have plenty of time to expand.

__[@0xs1g1l0](https://twitter.com/0xs1g1l0): What's something you are proud of?__

Now this one is tricky! I guess it would be the way people tell me I'm easy to talk to. Not to write some soppy deep sh!t, but ease of communication is something I think could be improved on in this space as a whole.

__[@DAMAKUSHI](https://twitter.com/DAMAKUSHI): How do I get in?__

Good question! I don't even know how I got in tbh, kind of a chad gacha.
