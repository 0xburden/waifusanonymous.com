# burden AMA  

__[@friend](https://twitter.com/friend): favorite anime__

This is a really hard question, so I won't really answer it directly.

Some anime that stand out are:
- Hyouka: a masterwork of high school fluff + mystery and slice of life
- Oregairu: a unique high school romcom with nice character development across the 3 seasons that are out
- Haruhi Suzumiya no Yuutsu: the one true god (also a fun scifi/fantasy high school romcom)
- Full Metal Panic!: mecha, babes, humor and heart -- what more do you need?  

__[@ConejoCapital](https://twitter.com/ConejoCapital): when you said click click clack clack click in your last spaces did you account for the geopolitical and regulatory implications of your powerful commentary__

Nope, and I won't apoligize for saying it either.

__[@0xrubiks](https://twitter.com/0xrubiks): Where did the name burden originate?__


It's similar to one of my actual names. I've used it in the past for some unreleased music stuff. That's pretty much it really.

__[@0xslot](https://twitter.com/0xslot): bobs or vagana__


Yes.

__[@xcfwee](https://twitter.com/xcfwee): how did you learn finance/crypto?__

YouTube (I know, I know) mostly. Started watching the (mostly) horrendous crypto folks on there few years ago, looking at charts and trading ever since. From there I eventually figured out the real knowledge was on Twitter (kinda) and then REALLY figured out that the folks worth listening to had anime pfps.

__[@0xpinkbones](https://twitter.com/0xpinkbones): how do i become an influencer like u__

You're already doing great, pinky.

__[@CryptoIppo](https://twitter.com/CryptoIppo): What is that warm sensation in my chest area when I look at you?__

Heart disease, maybe.

__[@heartwood__](https://twitter.com/heartwood__): I'm gay?__

Yes.

__[@mongolraider](https://twitter.com/mongolraider): Do you have a significant other? And if so why isn't it me__

I do, and it's not you because we just met.

__[@gustavMopasa](https://twitter.com/gustavMopasa): How are you?__

I'm alright. Spent all of today dev'ing on some of this website. Weather was okay. Trades are in the green finally.

__[@aabMihlu](https://twitter.com/aabMihlu): At what threshold will you feel as though you have made it?__

When I don't need a regularly paying job to feel okay with the bills I need to pay.

__[@Dropbear07](https://twitter.com/Dropbear07): Wen mint__

The mint is all around us at all times.

__[@bigdsenpai](https://twitter.com/bigdsenpai): What made you choose Yozora from Haganai specifically?__

(In reference to my anime pfp) This was mostly an arbitrary choice on a day where I was really set on choosing an anime pfp. However, Yozora has always been a special character for me. She's easily the worst girl in Haganai and genuinely sucks most of the time, but I related to her a bit when I was younger. Nasty personality + weird inferiority/superiority complex at times, etc.

Also she (me) has some of my favorite character design elements, at least for the beginning of the narrative -- she cuts her hair later on. *what if I told you burden also has long black hair?*

__[@0xwarpdancer](https://twitter.com/0xwarpdancer): waifusanon DAO when??__

Really, seriously, as soon as I get enough free time to figure out the ins/outs of DAOs. Got a few folks I've been meaning to pick the brains of about this.

__[@0xJim](https://twitter.com/0xJim): Do you think there's such thing as "the one"?__

If this is in reference to love, then yeah, sure. Stranger things have happened. Just don't idealize relationships too much in general, imo.

If this is in reference to The Matrix &trade; then of course, Neo is "the one".

__[@kriptokat_](https://twitter.com/kriptokat_): asuka or rei__

Didn't watch it (crucify me, I get it) -- idk probably asuka

__[@0xMitarai](https://twitter.com/0xMitarai): what do you like most about crypto? or maybe put another way, why are you in crypto?__

After a few years of obsession, I've started to turn a profit every so often, so I think I'll stay a while. Also the friendships I've made are incredible.

__[@bigsword69](https://twitter.com/bigsword69): what year will the first person to live over 1000 years (via robotics) be born?__

2021

__[@piplup_lover69](https://twitter.com/piplup_lover69): what is the best non debian/arch based distro__

Void Linux -- it's great, and it's community driven, and it's capable. I used to daily it and WOULD daily it rn if I had a desktop build.

__[@Rasukix](https://twitter.com/Rasukix): what is your biggest burden?__

chasing FOMO

__[@todomarukaori](https://twitter.com/todomarukaori): what first got you intro crypto?__

While in college I often heard about it in passing from the nerds around me (in an Information Technology program) and then slowly looked into it. I can recall seeing some nerd in a Guy Fawkes mask at Anime Expo in Los Angeles ('17 or '18, I can't remember) holding up a sign that said "BUY DOGECOIN" and thinking there really must be something to this stuff. Bought the top of some shitcoins with a few friends on binance that summer (TRX, ONT). At some point signed up for coinbase right around that BTC top at $20k, bought in some around $10k and watched it fall away during the covid-19 market crash. What kept me around was the fascination with understanding all the charts and the jargon. Now the friends keep me around more than anything.

__[@KianaXBT](https://twitter.com/KianaXBT): What fictional/anime/etc character is most similar to you in terms of irl personality?__

Picture an amalgamation of these characters:

- Hikigaya Hachiman from Oregairu
- Ishigami Yu from Kaguya-sama: Love is War
- Oreki Houtarou from Hyouka
- Yozora Mikazuki from Haganai
- Nifuji Hirotaka from Wotakoi

__[@0xs1g1l0](https://twitter.com/0xs1g1l0): what brightens your day?__

Seeing friends win, whether it's trades or releases of projects they've been dev'ing on or making irl big moves in career, etc. Makes me think some accomplishment of my own is just around the corner maybe.

__[@tesorasky](https://twitter.com/tesorasky): favorite waifu!__

At the moment, probably a tie between Marin from Sono Bisque Doll, Megumi from Saekano and Yoshiko from Love Live! Sunshine!!.

__[@Crypto15mod1](https://twitter.com/Crypto15mod1): y so cute__

nou

__[@0xNemissa](https://twitter.com/0xNemissa): what kind of trading system do you use?__

Ah, Nemissa. A good question. I base most of my trades on fib retracement, combined with some of the ichimoku system and bollinger bands + bullish divergence on certain oscillators. Scalps sometimes I use 9EMA+20EMA cross or s/r flips to go long/close. I don't really short very often.

__[@0xViolence](https://twitter.com/0xViolence): hmmm.. what's your favourite "clearing brain"/ winding down activity for in-between or after crypto stuff?__

Going for walks and listening to music or podcasts is a big one. Going for drives sometimes too. I like to smoke cigarettes and drink coffee/yerba mate as a break from work every so often as well.

__[@0x_emperor](https://twitter.com/0x_emperor): Waifusanonymous views on the market and macro__

I can't speak for all of us, but in general I think we're all bullish long term for now. I actually think things on a global/political scale are massively broken and shouldn't go on like this for much longer but realistically that's not how it's gonna play out.

Personally I think crypto is maturing as an asset and that's bullish macro as long as the world as we know it doesn't implode.

Trade the charts, always though.

__[@layofftheweed](https://twitter.com/layofftheweed): What is your version of success?__

Being able to life comfortably, but not luxuriously while at the same time being able to provide for my family and friends as well. It ain't fun if the homies can't have none.

__[@kurisuxbt](https://twitter.com/kurisuxbt): What thing do you like the most about CT?__

All the anime/manga fans coming together to get rugged and ape jpegs. (but really I mean the community of it all, there really is a group of peers for anyone on here)

__[@yvtweets](https://twitter.com/yvtweets): what got you started in crypto__

curiosity tbh -- mining, charting, trading. once I heard all these things I had no understanding of it becomes a personal mission to have a basic understanding. when I fall into hobbies, I fall HARD. DeFi summer really got it going for me in terms of this account, my portfolio, etc. Farmed sushi early on, got FUD'd out at a dollar, earned the UNI airdrop, things sort of spiraled from there.

__[@0xAlice_](https://twitter.com/0xAlice_): Who are you and if yes, how many?__

Federal Agent, 2+
