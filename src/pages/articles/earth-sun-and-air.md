There's recently been a lot of activity around bringing dao ownership styles into the IRL real estate game. Three of the big ones i've seen are [cityDAO](https://twitter.com/CityDao), [Praxis Society](https://twitter.com/PraxisSociety), and [Kong Land](https://kong.land/). Each one is taking a different approach to find a place in the existing legal structures of the world.

### CityDAO üí®

This one has been the most talked about. They bought 40 acres of land in Wyoming (a big state in the western USA that has recently passed laws allowing DAOs to operate as legal entities there).

This one is the most regulatory friendly. As the name implies, they are building a city, and tapping into [demand](https://twitter.com/garybasin/status/1461096160479825923) in the trad tech world. There's a couple other web2 style startups working on this kind of thing in other US states like Arizona i believe. We are also seeing [other web3](https://twitter.com/mikedemarais/status/1461549702982295553) people start to branch out into this concept.

They have  a NFT you can buy [here](https://opensea.io/collection/cdao). It represents your place in line to bid on purchasing the NFTs of land they are supposed to be releasing later this quarter.

### Praxis Society ‚òÄÔ∏è

Praxis on the other hand is proposing to build a sort of classical period meets transhumanism(?) somewhere in the mediterranean. It includes a lot of big names from the twitter aesthetics community like [SolBrah](https://twitter.com/SolBrah). 

Currently they are in talks with multiple different governments and the plan seems to be to create a SEZ (Special Economic Zone) within one of the decaying old world states and build a paradise of classicalism.

Praxis doesnt have a token or anything you can buy yet (unless you're a big accredited investor looking to lead a round maybe). What they do have is an accounting of "praxis points" which you can earn from things like posting memes, videos of you working out, and throwing out your evil seed oils.

### KongLand‚õ∞
![Kong Cash](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fandrewhy.de%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F12%2Fkong-cash-launch.jpg&f=1&nofb=1)
KongLand is planned to be based in El Salvador. They are headed by a multi exit techie who has focused a lot on physical products like IOT and is bringing that knowledge base to bear with Kong. The goal is to not only set up a physical location that kong [CITIZENs](https://kong.land/) can go to in El Salvador but also build a chip fab. 

A chip fab is a big undertaking (to the tune of billions and usually built over the course of years). Why is a chip fab worth building? To be a sovereign entity one has to be able to create munitions for the upcoming [hash wars](https://twitter.com/JasonPLowery/status/1460232592222048260?s=20) without relying on foreign industry.

Currently  you can buy their [$CITIZEN](https://www.dextools.io/app/ether/pair-explorer/0xf5d90ce04151979d0a7c8eaced8ed1419e190477) token and redeem them 1:1 if you'd like to  be  a citizen of KongLand. 

They also have KongCash (pictured above) which is a physical, flexible pcb board that you can redeem for ETH after a certain date. In effect it operates like a traditional currency on the gold or silver standard but its ETH backed instead.

There's more and more of these schemes popping up like [Prospera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pr%C3%B3spera) in Honduras (another Silicon Valley funded SEZ style one but they dont have anything like a token yet afaik) and the state of Nevada, USA which recently declared that [companies can buy up land and form their own county level government](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-56409924).

The main framework underlying all of these to varying degrees, seems to be ```pay a existing sovereign to borrow some of their legitimacy```. This concept was outlined 20+ years ago in [_The Sovereign Individual_](https://www.lopp.net/pdf/The%20Sovereign%20Individual.pdf). 

I've applied to basically all of these in some various capacities and believe that at the very least anyone who has made money this bullrun should try and hedge into at least one or buy a second citizenship in a existing state if you dont have a few already (read _The Soverign Individual_ if you dont understand why this is important). If not already occupied by other projects this is what i would be working on. Decentralizing finance is a  great place to start but the future seems much darker until sovereign power, production capacity, and humanity itself are decentralized.

This article was named to represent the main styles of vibes these places have so far and the one that's missing, water. I wonder  how long it will be until we see a dao pick up the [seasteading](https://www.freedomhaven.org/) flag or later even spacesteading. Awareness of the potental in sovereign states is [growing](https://twitter.com/scupytrooples/status/1461595190393593859?s=20). I hope to see one in the vein of [Kowloon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kowloon_Walled_City) in the 1950-90s or [Tortuga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tortuga_(Haiti)#History) in the 1640s.
